# TestStationStatus

This is a POC and a learning project (not production quality!)

This project was created as a homework exercise based on initial discussion from an internal project team.

My initial goals are -
 - to learn more about MVC development.
 - to create a open example of my work.
 - to improve user experience of an internal software project.
 
 A little background - 
 We have an internal automated test tool, it allows testers to develop test cases to run against our metering products using 
 an proprietary language. The tool has been developed in C# / WinForms, the code base although being feature rich uses none 
 of the modern C# design patterns (also the code comments are in German :p ). So after some discussion with a colleague I wanted 
 to find a way to extend the useability and features of the system without changing the existing code base (getting code changes
 to this global project is extremely slow and has a complex approval process). So after some weekend work this project was born.
